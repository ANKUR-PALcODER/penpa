<p> Diagonally Miracle Sudoku</p>
<p> After several tries, I was finally able to create this variant, inspired from miracle sudoku of course </p>
<p> Rules:</p>
<p>1. Normal classic rules apply</p>
<p>2. Same digits cannot touch each other diagonally (Antiking) </p>
<p>3. Consecutive digits don't touch diagonally (Diagonally nonconsecutive)</p>
<p>4. Same digits cannot be at diagonally knight positions (Diagonally Antiknight) </p>
<p> Note: Diagonally knight - Also known as monkey step - 3 cells in one direction and one to the side</p>
